										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s big things happening on and off the pitch at Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise Inter Miami CF. As well as star signing Lionel Messi banging in the goals and the team winning the 2023 MLS Leagues Cup, the MLS club co-owned by David Beckham has announced that construction has now started on its new 25,000-seater stadium.</p>
<p>The Miami Freedom Park &amp; Soccer Village, located near Miami International Airport, will be a 131-acre mixed-use development featuring the football-specific stadium, a public park and entertainment district. Scheduled to open in 2025, the timeline “aligns with the last year” of Messi’s current Inter Miami contract, which he signed in mid-July, MLS.com said.</p>
<p>Alongside football and athletic fields and a 58-acre public park, which will be the largest new park in Miami, the development will also include a “full range of entertainment and commercial offerings including office space, hotel, shops, restaurants and additional experiences and attractions” which will be delivered in phases through to 2030, the club confirmed in a statement.</p>
<p>Inter Miami’s current home is the DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, where they have played since their 2020 inaugural season.</p>
<p>Jorge Mas, Inter Miami CF managing owner: “With Inter Miami my family set out to build something truly transformational. In just four years we have changed the perception worldwide of American soccer. As we commence construction of Miami Freedom Park that same vision guides us. In creating a multi-faceted space we will set a new standard of what sport complexes can be. We look forward to delivering a food and entertainment destination for families to enjoy year-round. I can’t wait to welcome our fans to our state-of-the-art stadium and hear the chants as Messi and your Inter Miami players take the pitch for the first time in 2025.”</p>
<p>Devon McCorkle, president of Miami Freedom Park: “The level of attention and the influx of inquiries we are receiving have been incredible, a testament to the positive impact of Lionel Messi on Inter Miami CF and the City of Miami. Everyone wants to be part of what we’re creating, a new entertainment district that will be the centrepiece of family activities and experiences in Miami. We are in discussions with stadium sponsors, hotel brands, major attractions operators, restaurant groups, cultural institutions and many other exciting potential partners. We will deliver an incredible home for them at Miami Freedom Park.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is this the best padel court in the world? At Emerald Faarufushi Resort &amp; Spa in the Maldives, guests are encouraged to pick up a racquet and enjoy a game of padel tennis at the resort’s new floating court, surrounded by the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>From its quiet beginnings in the 1970s, padel tennis is now growing in popularity and quickly becoming one of the most exciting racquet sports for both professional players and enthusiasts around the world.</p>
<p>The new padel court is located on a private islet, connected by a jetty to Emerald Faarufushi Resort &amp; Spa’s seven-hectare island in the Raa Atoll. The over-water court, with its open and unobstructed views over the ocean, will welcome guests to rally with friends and family while taking in the coral reef and rich marine life in the resort’s private lagoon.</p>
<p>In this new sporty corner of the island, guests can also lace up their boots for a friendly kickabout or pick up a tennis racquet, thanks to a second multi-purpose field that also overlooks the ocean.</p>
<p>As part of The Emerald Collection’s signature <em>Deluxe All-Inclusive Formula</em>, access to the courts is free of charge no matter the room category guests book. In addition, guests can enjoy gourmet à la carte dining, an extensive and international list of more than 50 fine wines from around the world, and non-motorised water sports, all included in their room rate for a seamless stay.</p>
<p>Immersed in lush greenery and surrounded by a 100-hectare private lagoon with natural coral reef, Emerald Faarufushi Resort &amp; Spa is just 25 minutes by boat from the group’s first property, Emerald Maldives Resort &amp; Spa, which also features two tennis and padel courts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parisian landmark Place de la Concorde will host a village dedicated to rugby throughout the 2023 Rugby World Cup, which takes place in France from 8 September to 28 October. Pierre Rabadan, deputy mayor of Paris in charge of sport, the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Seine, unveiled the “Paris Rugby Village” programme and the city’s accessibility and eco-responsibility commitments.</p>
<p>The Paris Rugby Village will include a rugby entertainment and promotional area, plus two giant screens to broadcast RWC matches. And the number of screens will increase to four for the opening match on 8 September between France and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Visitors can enjoy entertainment and discovery areas, photo booths, the official France 2023 shop, exhibitions, and a central stage that will host the opening show as well as DJ sets and sporting and cultural performances. Catering areas and the “Bouillon” restaurant chain will be available for Parisians and visitors seeking refreshment.</p>
<p>The village will have a capacity of 15,000 visitors – and up to 39,000 on the opening day. If the French team qualifies for the finals, the village team will mobilise another 120 volunteers, including disabled support.</p>
<p>The village will open its doors on Friday 8 September at 2pm local time, to coincide with the opening RWC match between host nation France and the All Blacks at 9.15pm. A concert on the main stage will kick off festivities. It will be open to the public free of charge from 8 September to 28 October on Thursdays during French team matches and every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, from 2pm-11.30pm.</p>
<p>Organisers will set the village up in the eastern part of the Place de la Concorde – which will be closed to traffic – between the Tuileries Gardens and the centre of the square. The east side of the square will be closed to traffic from 9 August, with two-way traffic on the west side. The set-up of the Paris Rugby Village will begin on 9 August with the installation of the official shop (which will open earlier) and will continue until 23 August.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s the end of the road for Babylon Health, the London tele-health startup once valued...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s the end of the road for Babylon Health, the London tele-health startup once valued at nearly $2 billion after being backed by likes of DeepMind and deep-pocketed health insurance companies. After the company’s U.S. shares became worthless and its operation turned insolvent earlier this month, last night, the U.K. subsidiary of the business formally went into administration. At the same time, the administrators sold a large chunk of its assets to eMed Healthcare UK, a new subsidiary of U.S. company eMed.</p>
<p>The administrators, Alvarez &amp; Marsal, said in a short statement Babylon Healthcare Services Limited — the piece eMed is buying — covers the majority of what was left of Babylon Health, including a preventative tele-health practice that currently serves some 700,000 people in the U.K. though contracts with major providers like the private healthcare group Bupa.</p>
<p>GP at Hand, an app and service powered by Babylon that can be selected by U.K. residents as their primary health practice, is not a part of the sale, nor was put through any insolvency process, a spokesperson said. It’s still operational. (According to the site, it appears that three partners — Dr Stephen Jefferies; Dr Matt Noble and Rita Bright — are the primary owners of it.)</p>
<p>“The appointment of administrators over Babylon’s UK business to facilitate a sale to eMed ensures the least possible disruption for Babylon users, which should continue to operate as normal,” said Andrea Jakes, MD, Alvarez &amp; Marsal Europe LLP, in a statement.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed. We understand that employees are also included as part of the deal but have been unable to get a number of people impacted. The shares that have been halted in the U.S. operation are virtually worthless, with a market cap of just over $5,000.</p>
<p>The deal and U.K. administration phase come after many months of business turmoil at the company.</p>
<p>Babylon moved to the U.S. market on the back of a $4 billion+ SPAC plan in 2021. But while that might have looked like a power move to the market, in reality it also gave the company a chance to distance itself (and investors) from serious drama in its core business.</p>
<p>A clinician in the U.K. had for years been raising alarm bells about the company’s practices regarding patient safety and corporate governance. Some of that came to a head in 2021, when it emerged that a U.K. medical regulator had also been sharing and agreeing with the concerns for some time.</p>
<p>None of that had impacted business development for Babylon just yet. Even before the arrival of Covid-19 and the demand for more remote health services, Babylon had managed to ink a 10-year deal to build an app and health services for the city of Wolverhampton. But eventually the house of cards crashed. By 2022, the company was starting to reel after losing major contracts in its home market (including that NHS deal with Wolverhampton).</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, by 2023, Babylon was looking for a buyer, which it appeared to find in the form of Swiss health tech startup MindMaze — venture-backed and covered by us as one of the efforts in using VR and AR in medical research and healthcare — which had partnered up with AlbaCore, a shareholder of Babylon.</p>
<p>But talks were happening, it seemed, at a scramble: during the negotiations, Babylon’s shares tanked and were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Then at the start of August, that acquisition fell through. (We have tried to reach MindMaze to ask about the reasons; we have so far had no response. Babylon also declined to talk about specific details.)</p>
<p>Starting the process of looking for buyers of the assets, Babylon put the U.S. business in Chapter 7 insolvency to focus on its U.K. operations, which have been teetering on the bring of bankruptcy all month, until last night, when it finally fell.</p>
<p>“Babylon recently made the difficult decision to wind down its US Operations as its transaction with AlbaCore and MindMaze could not be finalised due to unforeseen circumstances. Firstly, we want to emphasize that there is no impact to the services we provide to our UK NHS GP at Hand, Direct-to-Consumer or Private patients and members. We continue to uphold the highest standards of care and service for our patients and members. Our UK business is a successful, distinct, and sustainable business, which provides high quality healthcare to many,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch at the time. “We are committed to continuing our day to day operations and innovating our technology capabilities and have reopened our GP at Hand list to patients effective Monday, 7th August 2023. We are in active discussions with a number of potential investors and partners to secure the financial future and continuity of the UK operation either as a standalone entity or in partnership with another body. Early interest in our business has been extremely encouraging and we will provide updates as they are available.”</p>
<p>And that’s how it landed today. From what we understand, eMed is going to keep the Babylon business it acquired operational for now, but it’s unclear what the plans will be going forward. eMed itself was once a startup itself, backed by the likes of Bessemer Ventures Partners, SV Health Investors and Credit Suisse. It looks like, according to PitchBook data, Cedara Software acquired the majority of the business in 2022. Its focus these days appears to be on the provision of tele-health services for people to remotely manage test, assessments and prescriptions for Covid-19, flu, weight loss programs and more.</p>
<p>Still to be addressed, however, are questions of whether eMed can make a profit out of a business that so clearly fell apart under its previous owner.</p>
